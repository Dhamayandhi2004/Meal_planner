Recipedia is a user-friendly, one-stop-shop for your weekly meal planning.  Designed with the busy professional in mind, the site allows users to search for recipes, favorite them for future reference, and build a weekly menu. Recipedia then generates a dashboard that shows the week's meals at-a-glance along with expected prep-time and required ingredients, which can be modified, emailed and/or texted as a shopping list.  With additional features like saved dietary preferences, nutrition information, and allergy restrictions/exclusions, Recipedia strives to ensure that the user has everything they need to build a delicious, healthy weekly meal plan at their fingertips.
